# Collision Detection
The collision of objects underlies most game experiences and many other user-interfaces (UIs). Baseball bats collide with balls, zombies bump into walls, and Mario lands on platforms and stomps turtles. This book explains the algorithms behind those collisions using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines.

#### WHAT YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW  
This book's examples are written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org), a wrapper for the Java programming language. While you need little programming experience to use these examples, you should understand how a basic Processing sketch is structured, how to use variables, how to draw shapes and get input from the mouse, and how `if/else` statements work. It may be helpful to understand using `PVector` objects to store positions, but we'll cover that a little bit if you haven't used them before. 

At the end, we will talk about using collision in object-oriented code. Understanding object-oriented programming will not be required to use this book, but it will be helpful for using these topics in larger projects.

#### WHAT'S COVERED HERE?
This book covers collisions between points, circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, and triangles (and a few bonus functions). Note that these examples are meant to be as readable and easily understood as possible. There are faster, more efficient ways to perform these collisions, but these examples are intended to teach the principles with minimal math :)

Examples include the collision algorithm as a function, followed by an interactive example.

#### WHAT'S NOT?  
As with any book, there's a lot more material than could be covered here. Things that aren't covered are mostly left out because the math gets too complicated. Three-dimensional space isn't touched on. Ellipses, which seem like they should be pretty easy, are actually very difficult.

If there's a specific collision not covered, please fill out an issue as a request (or better yet, submit an example!).
