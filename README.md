# Collision Detection
The collision of objects underlies most game experiences and many other user-interfaces (UIs). Baseball bats collide with balls, zombies bump into walls, and Mario lands on platforms and stomps turtles. This book explains the algorithms behind those collisions using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines.
