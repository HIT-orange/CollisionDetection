<h2>WHERE ARE THE OTHER TRIANGLE EXAMPLES?</h2>

<p>You might be wondering where all the other triangle collision examples are. The answer: we've already made them! The smallest number of sides a polygon can have is three, so all the polygon code will work for triangles too.</p>

<p>However, since our polygon code is meant to work with PVectors, included in the project repository are versions built just for triangles. You can call them as <code>triCircle()</code>, <code>triRect()</code>, etc.</p>
